            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">I am a Private Equity Analyst turned Software engineer. I am combining my talent for
                building and love of
                financial services to innovate and increase accesibility to technology and financial literacy.

                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I picked up coding during 2022 when I got my VR. I am an avid gamer and
                    was inspired by how immersed
                    I felt and how smooth everything ran via wifi. Over time, I have had an opportunity to use my
                    knowledge of product management and design with each project I have built. My ultimate code is to
                    become a lazy coder! I want to be able to automate processes on cloud platforms and physically
                    around me. </p>

                <h3>Private Equity & Financial Markets</h3>
                <p>I have spent 4 years studying the financial markets and private markets
                    at NYU Stern School of Business. I additionally spent nearly 2 years working on capital raising and
                    project management as
                    the lead analyst for our flagship North American infrastructure fund!</p>
